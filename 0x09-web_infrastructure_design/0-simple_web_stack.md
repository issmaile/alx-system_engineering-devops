# One-Server Web Infrastructure for foobar.com

## Infrastructure Overview:

- **Server**: A single physical or virtual machine responsible for hosting the entire web application.

- **Domain Name (foobar.com)**: This is the human-readable label used to access the website. It is configured to point to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8).

- **Web Server (Nginx)**: Nginx is a web server software that handles HTTP requests. It is responsible for serving static content and forwarding dynamic requests to the application server.

- **Application Server**: This server executes application logic, processes dynamic content, and communicates with the database.

- **Application Files (Code Base)**: These are the files containing the code that makes up the website. They are stored on the server and are executed by the application server.

- **Database (MySQL)**: MySQL is a database management system. It stores, organizes, and manages the website's data.

## User Accessing the Website:

1. A user wants to access the website and types "www.foobar.com" into their browser.

2. The user's computer sends a DNS query to resolve the domain name "www.foobar.com".

3. The DNS system translates the domain name into an IP address (8.8.8.8).

4. The user's computer sends an HTTP request to the server at IP 8.8.8.8.

5. Nginx, the web server, receives the request and processes it.

6. If the request is for static content, Nginx serves it directly. If it's for dynamic content, Nginx forwards it to the application server.

7. The application server processes the request, interacts with the database if necessary, and generates the appropriate response.

8. The response is sent back through Nginx to the user's computer.

9. The user's browser renders the received content, displaying the website.

## Issues with this Infrastructure:

### Single Point of Failure (SPOF):

- In this setup, the server itself is a single point of failure. If the server experiences a hardware or software failure, the entire website becomes inaccessible.

### Downtime during Maintenance:

- When deploying new code or performing maintenance tasks, the web server (Nginx) or the application server may need to be restarted. During this time, the website will be temporarily unavailable to users.

### Scalability Limitations:

- This infrastructure may struggle to handle a sudden increase in incoming traffic. A single server setup may not scale well to accommodate a large number of concurrent users.
